## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sophia!

I'm currently studying to become a **front-end developer**  
through an intensive coding bootcamp program 🚀

💡 Every day, I’m working hard to improve my skills and  
consistently recording what I’ve learned —  
because I believe growth comes from steady effort.

🔧 My current focus is on mastering **🌐 HTML**, **🎨 CSS**,  
and getting comfortable with version control using **🔀 Git**.

Thanks for stopping by! 🌱✨
