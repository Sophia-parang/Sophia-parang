<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 70%; text-align: left; padding-left:30px;">
 🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm currently studying to become a <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">front-end developer</span> through an intensive coding bootcamp program 🚀
<br><br>🖋 With a background in political scriptwriting and 🏛 museum exhibition planning, I’ve always loved helping people understand complex ideas — especially by making them visual and engaging.
<br><br>💻 Now, I’m channeling that same passion into front-end development,
where I can turn information into intuitive, user-friendly web experiences.
<br><br>💡 Every day, I’m working hard to improve my skills and consistently recording what I’ve learned — because I believe growth comes from steady effort.
<br><br>🔧 My current focus is on mastering <span style="font-weight: bold;">🌐 HTML</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">🎨 CSS</span>, and getting comfortable with version control using <span style="font-weight:bold;">🔀 Git</span>
<br><br>Thanks for stopping by! 🌱✨ </div>
